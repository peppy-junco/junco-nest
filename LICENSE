                PEPPY JUNCO LICENSE
                 Version 0.1
Peppy junco, any part of it, and any work derived from it or it's part is 
protected by this license.

The Peppy Junco License consists of GPLv3 and Peppy Junco Enterprise 
License. Hence, peppy junco is a dual license project.

GPLv3 should be ready for most of all who want to take benefit from our
Peppy Junco, the showy modern node monitor and management platform. This 
LICENSE file should be include without any modification when you
distribute peppy-junco or any part of it. And you should also have a full
GPLv3 include in the distribution or any derivative.

If you wanna have something other than GPLv3ï¼ŒPeppy Junco Enterprise
LICENSE is the choice. 

But frankly, whole clauses of Peppy Junco Enterprise is not ready. Just
contact us <chanuei@sina.com> per SOW to get start.

Right to change license is reserved. The team may change both the open 
source part or the enterprise part of the project.
